                <h3>Data Center</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Data centers are simply centralized locations where computing and networking equipment is concentrated for the purpose of collecting, storing, processing, distributing or allowing access to large amounts of data.
                <br>   
                <br> 
                    In the days of the room-sized behemoths that were our early computers, a data center might have had one supercomputer. As equipment got smaller and cheaper, and data processing needs began to increase -- and they have increased exponentially -- we started networking multiple servers (the industrial counterparts to our home computers) together to increase processing power. We connect them to communication networks so that people can access them, or the information on them, remotely. Large numbers of these clustered servers and related equipment can be housed in a room, an entire building or groups of buildings. Today's data center is likely to have thousands of very powerful and very small servers running 24/7.
                <br>
                <br>
                    Because of their high concentrations of servers, often stacked in racks that are placed in rows, data centers are sometimes referred to a server farms. They provide important services such as data storage, backup and recovery, data management and networking. These centers can store and serve up Web sites, run e-mail and instant messaging (IM) services, provide cloud storage and applications, enable e-commerce transactions, power online gaming communities and do a host of other things that require the wholesale crunching of zeroes and ones. Just about every business and government entity either needs its own data center or needs access to someone else's. Some build and maintain them in-house, some rent servers at co-location facilities (also called colos) and some use public cloud-based services at hosts like Amazon, Microsoft, Sony and Google.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    The different classifications of a data center: 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Hyperscale:
                <br>
                    A Hyperscale (or Enterprise Hyperscale) data center is a facility owned and operated by the company it supports. This includes companies such as AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Apple.
                    They offer robust, scalable applications and storage portfolio of services to individuals or businesses. Hyperscale computing is necessary for cloud and big data storage. Usually have a minimum of 5,000 servers linked with an ultra-high speed, high fiber count network. May use external companies on initial fit outs before maintaining internally. Noticeable difference from Enterprise to Hyperscale is the High Fiber Count utilized across the network.

                <br>  
                <br>  
                    Colocation:
                <br>    
                    Colocation Data Centers consist of one data center owner selling space, power and cooling to multiple enterprise and hyperscale customers in a specific location. Interconnection is a large driver for businesses. Colocation data centers offer interconnection to Software as a Service (SaaS) such as Salesforce, or Platform as a service (PaaS) like Azure. This enables businesses to scale and grow their business with minimum complexity at a low cost. Colocation companies offer technical guidance for companies that don’t know what they require, or want the hassle to source and deliver it. Other Colocation facilities have a slightly different model where chosen integrators provide the technical design, guidance and specification for migrating customers.
 
                <br> 
                <br>  
                    Wholesale:
                <br>    
                    Wholesale colocation data centers consist of one owner selling space, power and cooling to enterprise and hyperscale like standard colocation. In these instances Interconnection is not really a requirement. These facilities are used by hyperscale or large companies to hold their IT infrastructure. In most cases wholesale colocation provide the space, power and cooling. A number of wholesale colocation companies are adding standard colocation into their portfolio on the same sites where possible.    

                <br>
                <br>    
                    Enterprise:

                    Wholesale colocation data centers consist of one owner selling space, power and cooling to enterprise and hyperscale like standard colocation. In these instances Interconnection is not really a requirement. These facilities are used by hyperscale or large companies to hold their IT infrastructure. In most cases wholesale colocation provide the space, power and cooling. A number of wholesale colocation companies are adding standard colocation into their portfolio on the same sites where possible.

The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software. In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing systems are split into seven different abstraction layers:

                <h3>Transmission Control Protocol</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    It is a connection-oriented communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network. It is the most common protocol in networks that use the Internet Protocol (IP); together they are sometimes referred to as TCP/IP.
                <br>
                <br>
                    TCP takes messages from an application/server and divides them into packets, which can then be forwarded by the devices in the network – switches, routers, security gateways – to the destination. TCP numbers each packet and reassembles them prior to handing them off to the application/server recipient. Because it is connection-oriented, it ensures a connection is established and maintained until the exchange between the application/servers sending and receiving the message is complete.
                <br>
                <br>
                    For example, when an email (using the simple mail transfer protocol – SMTP) is sent from an email server, the TCP layer in that server will divide the message up into multiple packets, number them and then forward them to the IP layer for transport. At the IP layer, each packet will be transported to the destination email server. While each packet is going to the same place, the route they take to get there may be different. When it arrives, the IP layer hands it back to the TCP layer, which reassembles the packets into the message and hands it to the email application, where it shows up in the Inbox.
                <br>
                <br>
                    TCP is very useful protocol but still there are some tasks that are not possible to be performed by TCP, hence, Data Centre Transmission Control Protocol (DCTCP) is introduced.

                <h3>Data Center Transmission Control Protocol (DCTCP)</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Data centers host diverse applications, mixing on the same network a variety of workflows that require small, predictable latency, while other applications require large, sustained throughput. In this environment, today’s state-of-the-art Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control mechanisms do not provide sufficiently detailed congestion control settings. This results in queue formations in network switches leading to delays, fluctuations in latency, and timeouts.
                <br>
                <br>
                    To reduce this problem, Windows Server 2012 introduces DCTCP, which uses Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to estimate the extent of the congestion at the source, and reduce the sending rate only to the extent of the congestion. This provides a more detailed control over network traffic, allowing DCTCP to operate with very low buffer occupancies while still achieving high throughput.
                <br>
                <br>
                    The following illustration demonstrates the effectiveness of DCTCP in achieving full throughput while taking up a very small footprint in an Ethernet switch packet buffer, as compared to traditional TCP. The graph depicts the queue length in the network switch when using DCTCP and TCP. Two separate 1 gigabits per second (Gbps) TCP/IP streams are directed into two separate switch ports, and are combined into a single outgoing 1 Gbps port.
                <br>
                <br>
                    With traditional TCP, long-lived, large volume TCP flows cause the length of the bottleneck queue to grow until packets are dropped, resulting in the sawtooth pattern of the TCP traffic. When long and short flows traverse the same queue, two impairments occur. First, packet loss on the short flows may occur as described above. Second, there is a queue buildup even when no packets are lost. The short flows experience increased latency as they are queued behind packets from the large flows.
                <br>
                <br>  
                    DCTCP, however, provides earlier, more detailed responses to congestion, which effectively fine-tune the sending rates at each source to operate with much smaller message queue build-up in the switch, while maintaining the same aggregate throughput. The much lower queue lengths exhibited with DCTCP avoid the latency and variation in latency that occur with TCP.

                <h3>TCP Incast Problem</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    In TCP protocol, 2 phenomena cause TCP retransmission, one is 3 DUP ACKS and the other is timeout, where timeout aggressively degrades the throughput in a low latency, high throughput environment similar to data centers. 
                <br>
                <br>  
                    When too many clients and/or data center servers are sending lots of packets via routers/switches, their buffers might overflow and this would result in frequent packet loss. For short flows (which have very few packets), TCP timeout will occur more frequently as there are not enough packets to cause DUP ACKs. Thus, the data center server would be required to wait for the timeout period to expire before retransmitting the packet. This would increase the end-end latency and worsen the situation at switch/router queues due to more retransmission. This catastrophic decrease in TCP throughput is called Incast problem. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    TCP Incast is a catastrophic TCP throughput collapse that occurs as the number of storage servers sending data to a client increases past the ability of an Ethernet switch to buffer packets

                <h3>DCTCP Algorigthm</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    There are three components involved in the DCTCP algorithm:
                <br>
                <br>    
                    1.  The switches (or other intermediate devices in the network) detect  congestion and set the Congestion Encountered (CE) codepoint in the IP header.
                <br>
                <br>    
                    2.  The receiver echoes the congestion information back to the sender, using the ECN-Echo (ECE) flag in the TCP header.
                <br>
                <br>
                    3.  The sender computes a congestion estimate and reacts by reducing the TCP congestion window (cwnd) accordingly.
                <br>
                <br>
                    (1) Simple Marking at the Switch: DCTCP employs a very simple active queue management scheme. There is only a single parameter, the marking threshold, K. An arriving packet is marked with the CE code point if the queue occupancy is greater than K upon it’s arrival. Otherwise, it is not marked. This scheme ensures that sources are quickly notified of the queue overshoot. The RED marking scheme implemented by most modern switches can be re-purposed for DCTCP. We simply need to set both the low and high thresholds to K, and mark based on instantaneous, instead of average queue length.
                <br>
                <br>
                    (2) ECN-Echo at the Receiver: The only difference between a DCTCP receiver and a TCP receiver is the way information in the CE code points is conveyed back to the sender. RFC 3168 states that a receiver sets the ECN-Echo flag in a series of ACK packets until it receives confirmation from the sender (through the CWR flag) that the congestion notification has been received. A DCTCP receiver, however, tries to accurately convey the exact sequence of marked packets back to the sender. The simplest way to do this is to ACK every packet, setting the ECN-Echo flag if and only if the packet has a marked CE code point. However, using Delayed ACKs is important for a variety of  reasons , including reducing the load on the data sender. To use delayed ACKs (one cumulative ACK for every m consecutively received packets 3), the DCTCP receiver uses the trivial two state state-machine shown in Figure 10 to determine whether to set ECN Echo bit. The states correspond to whether the last received packetwas marked with the CE code point or not. Since the sender knows how many packets each ACK covers, it can exactly reconstruct the runs of marks seen by the receiver. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    (3)Processing Echoed Congestion Indications on the Sender: The sender estimates the fraction of byte sent that encountered congestion.  The current estimate is stored in a new TCP state variable, DCTCP.Alpha, which is initialized to 1.

                <h3>DCTCP Performance</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Throughput and queue length: By evaluating whether DCTCP achieves the same throughput as TCP on long-lived flows when recommended values of K are used. To determine this, we use machines connected to the Triumph switch with 1Gbps links. One host is a receiver; the others are senders. The senders establish long-lived connections to the receiver and send data as fast as they can. During the transfer, we sample the instantaneous queue length at the receiver’s switch port every 125ms. We repeat the experiment for both DCTCP and TCP. For DCTCP, we set K = 20, as recommended before. For TCP, the switch operates in standard, drop-tail mode. We find that both TCP and DCTCP achieve the maximum throughput of 0.95Gbps, and link utilization is nearly 100%. The key difference is queue length at the receiver interface. The CDF in Figure 13 shows that DCTCP queue length is stable around 20 packets(i.e., equal to K + n, as predicted in x 3), while the TCP queue length is 10X larger and varies widely. In fact, Figure 1 is based on the data from this experiment. It shows the time series of queue length (with 2 flows) for a representative period. The saw tooth behavior of TCP is clearly visible. The upper limit for TCP’s queue length is dictated by the switch’s dynamic buffer allocation policy, which will allocate up to _700KB of buffer to a single busy interface if no other port is receiving traffic. In contrast, DCTCP maintains a stable, low queue length.
